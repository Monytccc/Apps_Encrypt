##### Existing Features
1. Hashing:
used to scramble a message so that it is not easy to read that goes One way, which means the hash message cannot be decrypted again, this feature is very suitable for validating a password. Existing methods include: MD5,SHA-1,SHA-2(SHA224,SHA256,SHA384,SHA512),SsSHA-3(Output Length can be adjusted) and RIPEMD-160
2. Ciphers
Used to secure a text or message that goes both ways, which means that encryption and decryption can be carried out and depending on the key used, the existing algorithms include: Caesar Chipper, AES, DES, Triple DES, Rabbit, RC4, RC4Drop(Drop). Depends on the keyconverted to ascii decimal then sum/merged)
3.Encoders
Encoders function to encode a text or message that goes both ways but does not require a key, the existing encoders methods are as follows: Base64 and URL
4.Conversion
Conversion is used to convert a text message in ascii char format to a certain number base, or can be used as a calculator from a number base. Conversion methods include:
a. ASCII Char to binary or octal or decimal or hex
b. Binary or octal or decimal or hex to ASCII Char
c. or use for number base calculator
5. Morse Code
